Please change the hosting information before running this source code
- For admin function (login, logout,...), find the path config/connection.php
- For book store database, the path will be config/database_book.php

Then, use the sql database to import in your hosting to review the source code correctly via sql_db/qly_sach.sql  and  sql_db/users.sql


Pls kindly contact me if you figure out any issues in my source code, thank for your help:
